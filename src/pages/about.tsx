I'm Hindu and Buddhist, and  generally enjoy Computer Science and Econ. I've always been fascinated  with Science and Maths, be it through topping my class in elementary  school or qualifying for the top 25 in Olympiads. With that  interest in STEM, my dad encouraged me to start coding early, and I  considered it a fun activity. My journey pivoted in the  8th Grade when I left my unconventional Experiential learning school in  Gurgaon to join NAFL in Bangalore. The stem culture here was awesome,  and I developed a great appreciation for Electronics and Programming. I  spent a ton of time tinkering with electronics, working with  microprocessors and circuits to make fun projects. As an IGCSE student I  explored interesting CS theory like Logic gates and Image Optimization  Algorithms. With my growing knowledge of python, making projects was  fun."

I instantly fell in love  and slowly drove head first into the programming rabbit hole. Soon I  spent all my free time making websites, bots, and more. I started a  startup, volunteered for NGO's and even did a few internships and  freelance work. I was blown away by what I could make with code. Old  interests like PokÃ©mon, crypto and f1 fell into my programming projects.  I knew I had found what I was passionate about, and I ran with that!  The Open-source community was so powerful, and all the amazing people  I've met on GitHub have inspired me to do more. "

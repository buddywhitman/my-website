## Getting Started

You can either click one of the `Deploy` buttons on this repository or clone the repo directly from your terminal:

```bash
npx degit sozonome/nextarter-chakra <YOUR_APP_NAME>
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install

npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```
(I recommend using a single package manager for the project - yarn OR npm, mixing em can result in missing packages)

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
You can start editing the page by modifying `src/pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
